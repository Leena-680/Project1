  #Analysis: 
  Overall during this period, there was an increase in average price from 2009-2015. From 2013 it is possible to see that as % of Inflation decreases the prices of Uber continue to increase. 
  During the same period of 2012, it is possible to see that the number of rides year on year started to decrease.
  the data shows that there are more rides during Spring, this could potentially be related to people having more of a wish to be out after the cold winter months. 
  Limitations for this analysis are that it is only possible to infer analysis over the selected data set and may not represent the behavior of a population of New York of total Uber rides shared measured by Uber.
